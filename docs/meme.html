<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>Module MEME version 1.0 This module provides a set of methods for work with regulatory motifs. These methods integrate capabilities of three MEME Suite tools into KBase: - MEME is a tool for finding ungapped motifs in unaligned DNA sequences - TOMTOM is a tool for comparison of an input DNA motif to the elements of a database of known motifs - MAST is a tool for searching biological sequence databases for occurrences of known motifs</p>

<p>Data types summary MemeRunParameters data type keeps input parameters for MEME run. TomtomRunParameters data type keeps input parameters for TOMTOM run. MastRunParameters data type keeps input parameters for MAST run. MemeSite data type represents a particular site from MEME motif description. MemeMotif data type represents DNA sequence motif predicted by MEME. MemeRunResult data type represents result of a single MEME run and contains parameters of the search and list of identified motifs. MemePSPM data type represents a position-specific letter-probability matrix for use with TOMTOM and MAST. MemePSPMCollection data type contains collection of matrices for use with TOMTOM and MAST. TomtomHit represents a results of comparison of two matrices by TOMTOM. TomtomRunResult represents result of a single TOMTOM run. MastHit represents a particular MAST hit. MastRunResult represents results of a single MAST run.</p>

<p>Methods summary find_motifs_with_meme - runs MEME for a set of nucleotide sequences provided as SequenceSet object and returns MemeRunResult object find_motifs_with_meme_from_ws - runs MEME for a set of nucleotide sequences provided as workspace ID of the SequenceSet and returns kbase ID of MemeRunResult object saved in workspace find_motifs_with_meme_job_from_ws - runs MEME for a set of nucleotide sequences provided as workspace ID of the SequenceSet and returns job ID compare_motifs_with_tomtom - runs TOMTOM for MemePSPM as query vs. MemePSPMCollection as target and returns TomtomRunResult (list of motif pairs) (removed)compare_motifs_with_tomtom_from_ws - runs TOMTOM for MemePSPM as query vs. MemePSPMCollection as target provided as workspace IDs and returns kbase ID of the TomtomRunResult saved in workspace (removed)compare_motifs_with_tomtom_job_from_ws - runs TOMTOM for MemePSPM as query vs. MemePSPMCollection as target provided as workspace IDs and returns job ID compare_motifs_with_tomtom_by_collection - runs TOMTOM for two collection of PSPMs and returns TomtomRunResult (list of motif pairs) compare_motifs_with_tomtom_by_collection_from_ws - runs TOMTOM for two collection of PSPMs provided as workspace IDs and returns kbase ID of the TomtomRunResult saved in workspace compare_motifs_with_tomtom_job_by_collection_from_ws - runs TOMTOM for two collection of PSPMs provided as workspace IDs and returns job ID find_sites_with_mast - runs MAST for MemePSPM vs. SequenceSet and returns MastRunResult (list of MAST hits) (removed)find_sites_with_mast_from_ws - runs MAST for MemePSPM stored in workspace vs. SequenceSet stored in workspace and returns kbase ID of MastRunResult (list of MAST hits) saved in workspace (removed)find_sites_with_mast_job_from_ws - runs MAST for MemePSPM stored in workspace vs. SequenceSet stored in workspace and returns job ID find_sites_with_mast_by_collection - runs MAST for MemePSPMCollection vs. SequenceSet and returns MastRunResult (list of MAST hits) find_sites_with_mast_by_collection_from_ws - runs MAST for MemePSPMCollection stored in workspace vs. SequenceSet stored in workspace and returns kbase ID of MastRunResult (list of MAST hits) saved in workspace find_sites_with_mast_job_by_collection_from_ws - runs MAST for MemePSPMCollection stored in workspace vs. SequenceSet stored in workspace and returns kbase ID of MastRunResult (list of MAST hits) saved in workspace get_pspm_collection_from_meme_result - converts MemeRunResult into MemePSPMCollection get_pspm_collection_from_meme_result_from_ws - converts MemeRunResult into MemePSPMCollection and writes the result to workspace get_pspm_collection_from_meme_result_job_from_ws - returns ID of job object that contains ID of MemePSPMCollection converted from MemeRunResult</p>
